This is the SCSS toolkit for the HEX brand. It is an attempt to provide simplicity
and abstraction similar to Bootstrap, but with our own aesthetic. It will be a
no-bullshit look in black and white.

Should be good, stay tuned.

## Usage and documentation

This toolkit is a customized version of the [Pure CSS framework][pure] from Yahoo.
All the documentation on that framework is valid here as well.

The differences will be mainly stylistic at first. New components will be listed
here when they are developed.
