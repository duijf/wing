## Philosophy

Your average startup's website is rather flashy. Before you get to the gist of
the product, you need to scroll past hero-banners and embedded videos and
a shit-ton of icons.

**Unnessesary**. Strong copy, nice typography, appropriate calls to action
and a quality information architecture will get you rather far.

Wing will give you everything you need to build a quality website, and nothing
more.
