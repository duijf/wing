## Typography

Wing comes with some sane typographic defaults. Here is what we do for you:

 * Align everything to a [baseline grid]. It consists of units of **27px**.
   Everything on the page snaps to it. Keeping everything aligned requires
   some discipline, but it makes the type on your website stand out.
 * Wing sets the heading and body font to Mozilla's `Fira Sans` and uses
   `Source Code Pro` from Adobe for monospace.
 * Thanks to [Normalize.css], the default styling of HTML elements is left
   untouched.
 * Wing sets a couple of opinionated defaults with regards to typography.
   The intention here is to aid you in sticking to some of the basic rules
   of type, even though you don't know them. You'll have to conciously override
   these rules.
